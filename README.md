# DataStructure-Mini-Project : Student Data Manager

Designing a C Program that will work as a Student Data Manager. 
We can store the records of student In a File, and it can also be modified or removed if we want. We can sort the student according to surname in order to generate ROLL NO and also we can sort student according to their CGPI. We can search student easily using their ID or name. We can append the data of new students added and we can also sort the new data and previous data and write it in the same file.
We have used Doubly Linked List in our project, as in Doubly Linked List we have previous and next o fields using which we can traverse easily to previous and next node. Linked List also gives us advantage of memory space as the amount of data we add only that much data occupies memory.
main.c file includes the pure code with no comments.
data.txt file shows how data is stored in a file.
DSReport.docx gives you entire report on our project.
